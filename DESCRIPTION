Description: Functions and data are provided that support a course
        that emphasizes statistical issues of inference and generalizability.  
        The functions are designed to make it straightforward to illustrate
        the use of cross-validation, the training/test approach, simulation, 
        and model-based estimates of accuracy.  Methods considered are
        Generalized Additive Modeling, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant
        Analysis, Tree-based methods, and Random Forests.
