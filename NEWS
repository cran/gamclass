                  Changes in gamclass version 0.57
                  
Changes in vignettes  
  o Argument `reg.line=NA`, in  calls to the `car` functions
    `sp()` and `spm()` has been changed to `regLine=TRUE`, as
    required in `car` versions >=3.0.0 .
  o An argument `diag="boxplot"`, in figs5.Rnw in a call to
    `car::spm()`, becomes `diagonal=list(method="boxplot")`,
    as required in `car` versions >=3.0.0 .

                  Changes in gamclass version 0.53

NEW FEATURES
  o Functions plotFars() an tabFarsDead() do not now have an argument
    'data'.  Instead, to deal with a "No visible binding" message, 
     data('FARS', package='gamclass', envir=environment()) is used
    to place the dataset 'FARS' in the function environment, with
    FARS <- get("FARS", envir=environment()) used to appease the
    CRAN check.
  o The functions eventCounts() (counts of events by specified intervals),
    gamRF() (use repeated sampling to compare interpolation accuracy of
    GAM model + randomForests fit to residual), addhlines() (plot
    horizontal lines to show rpart fitted values) and bssBYcut()
    (between group SS for y, for all possible splits on a value of x)
  o Vignettes figs7 and figs8 are new.  The former vignettes figs7:figs9
    have become figs9:figs11
  o The dataset airAccs has been added.
