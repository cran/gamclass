                  Changes in gamclass version 0.62
                  
NEW FEATURES
   o The data objects `frontDeaths`, `rearDeaths`, `sideDeaths`,
   `otherDeaths`, and `relDeaths` have been added.
   o plotFars() now has an argument `tabDeaths`, which may be 
   one of `frontDeaths`, or `rearDeaths`, or `sideDeaths`, or
   `otherDeaths`, as returned by the function `tabFarsDead()`.
   o The function `tabFarsDead()` has been added.
   o The data object `FARSmiss` has been omitted.
   o Records in the dataset `FARS` have been restricted to
   those that are of interest for analyses such as are 
   presented in the vignette `AirbagEffectiveness`.
   o The dataset `bomregions2018` has been added.  This has
   annual averages of meteorological data (temperature and 
   rainfall) for Australian regions, plus annual averages 
   of the Southern Oscillation Index, of CO2 levels, and
   of the Dipole Mode Index for the Indian Ocean Dipole.
   o The dataset `coralPval` has been added.  ThisÂ has
   P-values were calculated for each of 3072 genes, for 
   data that compared genetic expression values between 
   post-settlement coral larvae and pre-settlement coral
   larvae.

                  Changes in gamclass version 0.57
                  
Changes in vignettes  
  o Argument `reg.line=NA`, in  calls to the `car` functions
    `sp()` and `spm()` has been changed to `regLine=TRUE`, as
    required in `car` versions >=3.0.0 .
  o An argument `diag="boxplot"`, in figs5.Rnw in a call to
    `car::spm()`, becomes `diagonal=list(method="boxplot")`,
    as required in `car` versions >=3.0.0 .

                  Changes in gamclass version 0.53

NEW FEATURES
  o Functions plotFars() an tabFarsDead() do not now have an argument
    'data'.  Instead, to deal with a "No visible binding" message, 
     data('FARS', package='gamclass', envir=environment()) is used
    to place the dataset 'FARS' in the function environment, with
    FARS <- get("FARS", envir=environment()) used to appease the
    CRAN check.
  o The functions eventCounts() (counts of events by specified intervals),
    gamRF() (use repeated sampling to compare interpolation accuracy of
    GAM model + randomForests fit to residual), addhlines() (plot
    horizontal lines to show rpart fitted values) and bssBYcut()
    (between group SS for y, for all possible splits on a value of x)
  o Vignettes figs7 and figs8 are new.  The former vignettes figs7:figs9
    have become figs9:figs11
  o The dataset airAccs has been added.
